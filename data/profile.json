I've built applications serving 15,000+ users with 99.94% uptime, reduced manual work by 60%, and processed $2M+ in transactions with zero security incidents. I excel at designing distributed architectures, from microservices handling 50,000+ daily requests to rate-limiting systems processing 100,000+ requests/second. I combine deep technical expertise across the full stack with a results-driven mindset focused on real-world impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about your ML/AI experience",
      "answer": "I have both research and production AI/ML experience. At CSUF, I worked on an NSF-funded project ($172,000 grant) developing machine learning models for disaster and health emergency management—work that was featured in university research publications and contributed to California wildfire response systems. On the production side, I've built AI-powered applications using GPT-4, LangChain, and RAG systems, including a financial assistant that reduced manual reporting time 60% and achieved 92% user satisfaction while processing 10,000+ monthly queries. I'm NVIDIA-certified in building RAG agents with LLMs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of role are you looking for?",
      "answer": "I'm looking for a full-stack or backend engineering role where I can leverage my experience building distributed systems at scale. I'm particularly excited about positions involving AI/ML integration, microservices architecture, real-time data processing, or systems serving large user bases with high reliability requirements. I thrive in environments that value measurable impact, whether that's startup velocity or enterprise-scale infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you describe your experience with distributed systems?",
      "answer": "I have hands-on experience designing and building distributed systems from scratch. At Patientxpress, I architected microservices handling 50,000+ daily requests with 99.8% uptime and sub-200ms latency. I've built distributed AI systems coordinating 500+ daily operations across multiple clinics, implemented event-driven architectures, and designed RESTful APIs with webhook integrations. In my personal projects, I built a distributed rate-limiting system in Go + Redis handling 100,000+ requests/second across multiple regions with sub-10ms latency. I also have experience with Redis pub/sub for cross-server communication and fault-tolerant systems with graceful failover."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure system reliability and performance?",
      "answer": "I approach reliability through multiple layers: infrastructure design (CI/CD with automated testing, feature flags, multi-environment deployments), architecture patterns (microservices, event-driven design, Redis caching), monitoring (CloudWatch, real-time analytics dashboards), and database optimization (query tuning, indexing strategies). My track record shows this works—I've maintained 99.94% uptime on systems serving 10,000+ users, 99.8% uptime on microservices handling 50,000+ daily requests, and achieved 99% crash-free rates. I also implement comprehensive error handling and design for graceful degradation during failures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your experience working in cross-functional teams?",
      "answer": "I've successfully collaborated with diverse teams in various environments. At CEDDI Lab, I worked with data scientists, public health officials, and geography researchers across 3 counties, navigating an ambiguous research environment with 6 cross-functional stakeholder groups. At Patientxpress, I coordinate with product, engineering, and healthcare operations teams. At Global Spark Tek, I rapidly prototyped solutions in a startup environment with shifting priorities while wearing multiple hats across frontend, backend, and DevOps. I'm comfortable with Agile/Scrum methodologies and pride myself on clear communication and ability to translate technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved",
      "answer": "At CEDDI Lab, I needed to enable hourly updates for a COVID-19 tracking dashboard used by the California Department of Public Health, but our ETL pipeline was taking 42 minutes to refresh. I redesigned the entire pipeline, optimizing database queries for multi-source data integration (population, environmental, geospatial), implementing parallel processing, and adding incremental updates instead of full refreshes. The result was a 67% reduction in refresh time (42min→14min), enabling hourly updates and making the dashboard much more valuable for real-time decision-making during the pandemic. This required deep understanding of PostgreSQL optimization, Python async processing, and careful coordination with the data science team."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are you open to remote work?",
      "answer": "Yes! I'm open to remote, hybrid, or on-site positions. I've successfully worked remotely at Global Spark Tek and have strong experience with distributed team collaboration, asynchronous communication, and self-management. I'm also willing to relocate for the right opportunity."
